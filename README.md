# rsimg

Terminal image viewer written in rust which displays images with unicode charactors.

Able to display Jpeg and Png types with rgb and rgba colourspaces and truecolour.

This is a inspired by [catimg](https://github.com/posva/catimg/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file).

Currently uses crossterm and zune as dependancies, but these are attempted to be phased out.
